# 🎓 College Networking System – Cisco Packet Tracer Project

A simulated college networking system created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. This project demonstrates the implementation of a structured network architecture for a college environment, including interconnections between departments, server access, and secured data transmission.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to replicate a real-world college campus network. It includes administrative offices, faculty rooms, computer labs, library, and student zones — all connected using routers, switches, and end devices. The simulation ensures:

- Efficient communication between departments
- Controlled internet access
- Centralized server management
- Real-time data transmission within the network

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** – Network simulation tool
- **Devices Used:**
  - Routers (e.g., 2811)
  - Switches (e.g., 2960)
  - PCs and Laptops (for students/faculty)
  - Servers (for DNS, HTTP, File Sharing, etc.)
  - Wireless Routers (if included)
  - Access Points and Repeaters (optional)
  - Cabling (Copper Straight-Through, Cross-Over, Fiber)
